# Rock.it ASP.net Project

A user generated content system, basically a scaled down version of Reddit, like it was at first without subreddits and custom user feeds. Users can post to the feed, comment to a post, upvote/downvote content to contribute to a simplified karma system, a stretch goal is to implement a threaded comment system (comment to individual comments).
